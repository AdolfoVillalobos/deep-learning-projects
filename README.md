# Deep Learning Experimentation

This is a repo for my experimentation with Deep Learning (DL) problems using popular frameworks and models.

I have divided my interests in the following categories of tasks:

1. Natural Language Processing
2. Computer Vision and Image Processing
3. Generative Model
4. Reinforcement Learning
5. Structured Data
